    <p id="p1">Hi my name is James Warburton. I have loved computers my whole life and technology but i just now jumped the gun to be
        a programmer. I was an avid golfer in my younger years and got to play many large competitions and win a few events.
        I learned that anything in life takes hard work, if you want something in life you have to work hard at it to get
        it, practice makes permanent.
    </p>
    <p>I am attending the UCSD bootcamp full flex 3 moth program so i can develop the skills necessary to start my passion for
        coding. I have so many goals that i want to achieve. I have so many good ideas and have had so many in teh past that
        i wasnt able to do because i couldn't code. So now i am making the necesary steps to get to my goal. I am a dedicated
        individual and very obsessive with things i have interest in. This is one of them.
    </p>
